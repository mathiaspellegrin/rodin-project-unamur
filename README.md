# Formal Verification of Single-Track Tram Systems

## Description
This project is a formal modeling project that uses Event-B and the Rodin platform to develop and verify a safety-critical control system for trams on single-track networks. The model employs stepwise refinement to progressively build a provably correct system for traffic management, collision avoidance, and passenger information.

## Development Approach
1. **Initial model**  
   - Basic tram movement on a network  
2. **First refinement**  
   - Adding station types, track sensors and signals  
3. **Subsequent refinements**  
   - Collision prevention  
   - Driver interfaces  
   - Dispatching validation  
   - Emergency procedures  
   - Passenger information systems  

## Requirements
- Rodin Platform 3.x or newer  
- BMotion Studio (for visualization)
